				<div itemprop="name">
				 I had a scary dream a few years ago about a girl standing on the top of a mountain trembling with fright.  When I awoke I remembered the dream, I jumped out of bed, ran down stairs, sat down and began to write.  This turned into my first book, ‘That Magnificent Medallion’, not, of course, without many changes.  From this came another
three, each one with the same main characters, they are ‘Keep Out’, ‘Wow’ and ‘Quiro’s Map’.

		<h2>And a peek inside:</h2>
		<h3>

            <b>‘That Magnificent Medallion’</b> introduces Amanda and her two friends, Sue and Gale, a handsome, young man who of all things is called Passbar, the dwarfs and it goes without saying a very evil man – Bola Barana.  I must also warn you that there happens to be the ‘Ogre’, Bola Barana’s equally evil assistant.  They’re definitely going to put shivers up your spine.
			<br><br>
            <b>In the second book ‘Keep Out’</b>, Amanda, after quite a bit of opposition, manages to persuade Sue and Gale  to go to Abina, supposedly the richest country in Africa.  There Amanda, in the palace dungeons, meets a Prince and what happens to them, as to Sue and Gale, is not for the faint hearted.  But, Passbar suddenly appears and may well put things to right.
			<br><br>
            <b>The third book is ‘Wow’</b>.  Amanda, Sue and Gale are on holiday in New York when the evil villain Bola Barana’s uncle, Vam Vampdie and a Don, a very scornful, sneering high priest turned it all upside down,  But as always Passbar is there to help them.  
			<br><br>
            <b>And last but not least is ‘Quiro’s Map’</b>.  Amanda, Sue and Gale, Passbar and his two friends the dwarfs, Sina and Misko are invited to a great celebration by the Don on his island.  What happens to them is anyone’s guess!
			<br><br>
            These four books are certainly exciting, and also sometimes a bit scary. But they can also be quite funny and will definitely bring a huge smile to your face when you read the very happy ending.
